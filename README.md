## Orbital Log

### Milestone 1 (2 June)

Current Progess:
Currently as of right now, we have only touched on the frontend aspect of the project. We have created an interactive website where users are able to upload their mp4 file and enter multiple timestamps where they wish their video could be clipped. Then when they click the submit button, they will be brought to a new page where they can "download" the video.

Future Plan:
Download is in "" in the previous paragraph because we have yet to build the video processing aspect of the app, which is arguably will be the most important aspect of our app as we are still researching and experimenting with the different ways we can achieve our goal. So our future plan is to establish the backend as well as to decide on how we wish to tackle the main bulk of processing in the web app.

Reflections:
As of right now, we feel that we are learning a lot by being able to build this app. Though it has been challenging we are looking forward to learning more and gaining more experience, especially with react. We also realised that there is so much information on the web and we are slowly improving in the way that we absorb all this information such that it will benefit us and this project in a shorter amount of time.
